## What is a good food? Executive Summary:

Calories are units of energy that our bodies use to function properly. They are essential for:

1. Maintaining basic bodily functions
2. Providing energy for physical activity
3. Supporting healthy growth and development in children
4. Without sufficient calories, our bodies would not be able to carry out these essential functions, leading to fatigue, muscle weakness, and other health problems.

According to the quantity of the nutrient, food can have more or fewer calories. Calories are defined by:

- **Proteins, carbohydrates, and fats:** They are the main elements that define the calories of a food: The more food has proteins, carbohydrates and fats, higher is the amount of calories.
